This uploaded code - is mini-quest-game.
This code has several functions that drive game progress.
This is some kind of world, some kind of kingdom, some kind of area, I havenâ€™t figured out the lore yet.
The game has its own tutorial, so you can figure it out yourself.
The game is still in development, only the main menu, the store and some part of the dungeon work.
